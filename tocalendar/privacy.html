    <h1>Privacy Policy for ToCalendar</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: September 13, 2025</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      ToCalendar is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or
      transmit any personal information from our users.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Data Processing</h2>
    <p>
      All document scanning and calendar integration happens locally on your
      device. Your documents, calendar data, and extracted events never leave
      your device and are not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      ToCalendar may use AI services for document analysis. When using these
      services, only the content of documents you choose to scan is processed.
      No personal information or calendar data is included in these requests.
    </p>

    <h2>Subscription Data</h2>
    <p>
      Subscription purchases are processed through Apple's App Store. We do not
      collect or store any payment information. Apple handles all subscription
      management and billing according to their privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Calendar Access</h2>
    <p>
      ToCalendar requests access to your calendar solely to add events you
      approve. We do not read, modify, or access existing calendar events beyond
      what is necessary for duplicate detection.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Any temporary data created during document processing is stored locally on
      your device and automatically deleted after processing is complete.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Information</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at
      [your email].
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users
      of any material changes through the app or this website.
